# Mkdocs custom plugin example

This repository contains a simple examples of extending the standard MkDocs functionality with a custom extension.

In this Mkdocs sample we're using the [klipse plug-in](https://github.com/viebel/klipse) to make some of the Python code editable - i.e. the Python examples on the page can be edited by the user in real-time, and the displayed output from the code will change. 

The live example can be [viewed here](https://vle.york.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/institution/E-Learning%20Development%20Team/StaticSiteExamples/mkdocs-plugin/mkdocs-plugin/index.html).
